Robots act in the real world. When deploying machine learning on robots,
the continuous and dynamic nature of the physical world raises many
challenges which are not encountered in purely digital domains such as
Internet search and social networks. As an example, many learning
algorithms rely on exploration, which, when deployed on real robots, may
potentially result in physically dangerous behaviors and costly
wear-and-tear.

The main objective of this workshop is to provide a forum for
identifying such challenges, to present state-of-the-art research
methods for addressing them, and to highlight best practices for
transferring such methods from research to industry. An important
question is to identify *when* learning algorithms could and should be
used during a robot lifecycle, *how* they should be used, and *what
for*.

This workshop thus brings together roboticists from academia and
industry, to enable an interactive exchange on the future of robot
learning, and best practices on transferring ideas to the real world of
industrial competition. The speakers at this workshop all aim at real-world robotic applications of
machine learning methods. Furthermore, many speakers are active both in
academia and industry.


This workshop is the second edition of "New Horizons for Robot
Learning", the first which was held at IROS 2020
(<https://iros.ai-lab.science/>).

## Format and schedule

The workshop is organized as a set of live interviews with global leaders in the field of machine learning and robotics. Questions are tailored to the main workshop topic, and will specifically focus on innovation, i.e. the transition from research ideas to their practical implementation as a product or service. The audience will be able to provide additional questions during the workshop. The insights from the interviews will form the basis for a panel discussion with all the invitees.
